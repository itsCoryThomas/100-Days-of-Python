# 100-Days-of-Python
I'm taking Dr. Angela Yu's '100 Days of Code' course in Python in an effort to push my boundaries with Python and take on new challenges.

Focuses:
Readability as a skill- making sure my code can be read and used by other's.
Coding without guidance- anyone can follow a tutorial... I'm looking to challenge myself to complete the projects (Yu's teaching style is perfect for this).
Drive - completing the 100 days (hopefully) within 100 days- but most of all, completing it in general.
